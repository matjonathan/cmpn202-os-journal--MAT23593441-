# CMPN202 Operating Systems – Technical Journal

**Student Name:** Jonathan Matuka   
**Student ID:** MAT23593441  
**Module:** CMPN202 – Operating Systems  
**Programme:** Software Engineering  
**Academic Year:** 2025/26  

This GitHub Pages site documents my 7-week technical journal for the Operating Systems coursework.  
The journal shows:

- How I planned, configured, secured, and evaluated a Linux server and workstation.
- Evidence of command-line use (SSH, security tools, monitoring, scripting).
- Performance and security analysis, including trade-offs and reflections.
- Weekly progress, problems encountered, and how I solved them.

> Note: All work is performed in a VirtualBox environment using a headless Linux server accessed via SSH from a workstation system, in line with the coursework specification.

## How to Read this Journal

Each weekly page contains:

1. **Objectives for the week** – what I aimed to achieve.
2. **Implementation details** – commands, configurations, scripts, and screenshots.
3. **Analysis** – performance, security, and trade-offs.
4. **Reflection** – what I learned, what went wrong, and what I would improve.

All command-line screenshots show the prompt (`username@hostname`) and are taken from the VirtualBox environment.
